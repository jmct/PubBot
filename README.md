PubBot
======

Eventually a Twitter bot DSL, now it just tweets back at you.

Short term goal, simple DSL with enough power to:

* Store twitter handles
* search tweets for specific data
* execute actions at specific events or specified times

This should provide enough power to implement the first bot, which will be PubBot.

PuBot has one job.

You tweet at it to say you're interested to go to the pub, maybe even tell it what time you want to go.
It will tweet at all the interested parties a few minutes before the set leaving time.
